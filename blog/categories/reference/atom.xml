    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On an interview with <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>, I made the mistake
of stating that one of the benefits of working with JavaScript over C is
that functions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first class</a>
in JavaScript, therefore they may be <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter6.html">passed around</a>.  To which the
interviewer replied, &ldquo;Well, C can do that, what about function pointers?&rdquo;  What? Luckily, I
was able to get out of that jam by guessing that JavaScript had a nicer
syntax.</p>

<p>While I was taught some C in university, we had never gone over function
pointers or more in depth topics such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library">static</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_library">dynamic</a> <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html">linkage</a>.
I was so embarrassed that my expensive (read <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324442304578231922159602676.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTTopStories">overpriced</a>)
degree had not taught me more about
the C programming language, especially from the Computer Engineering
department that focuses on software <strong>AND</strong> hardware.  On my exit
interview with the dean, I was very opinionated on the amount of C that
was (or wasn&rsquo;t) taught at my university.  His argument was that there
are only so much of so many languages you can cover in a university, which
to some extent is valid.  My problem has been that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed learning
many different programming languages, though I didn&rsquo;t really get it the
first time around (with Java).  I think knowing many different languages
and their respective paradigms makes you a better programmer in other
languages, since you can bring a <a href="http://therubyway.org/">Ruby Way</a> to
<a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> or a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-javascript/index.html">JavaScript functional</a>
<a href="http://interglacial.com/hoj/hoj.html">style</a> into C.</p>

<p>I had read two books in the meantime that really flushed out more of the
C language to me and I would definitely recommend them to those who want
to learn more about the language. They are <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920015482.do">Head First C</a> by Dave and Dawn
Griffiths and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025108.do">21st Century C</a> by Ben Klemens.
I&rsquo;m also aware that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a> by
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is also known as the canonical text.
The book is often referred to as &lsquo;K&amp;R&rsquo; after the authors' initials, and Dennis
Ritchie was the original creators of the C language and co-developer of
Unix.  I&rsquo;d love to get a chance to read it someday.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.charlescary.com/?p=95">This article</a> appeared on
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and really piqued my
interest.  Defenitely a great read.  What really stuck out to me was one
of the <a href="http://blog.charlescary.com/?p=95#comment-31">comments</a> though.
The author of the comment mentioned a less ugly syntax for function
pointers, with a <a href="http://pastebin.com/MsJLY22j">link to an example</a>.
Now I&rsquo;m not sure what the commenter meant by &ldquo;these params decay
naturally to function pointers&rdquo; but I was skeptical about this different
syntax.  Even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer#Example_in_C">Wikipedia article</a>
used the syntax that I was familiar with.  So I wrote up a quick example
to try it:</p>

<p>```c
// compiled with:
// clang -Wall -Wextra function_pointers.c -o function_pointers</p>

<h1>include &ldquo;stdio.h&rdquo;</h1>

<p>void usual_syntax (void (*fn) (int x)) {
  puts(&ldquo;usual syntax start&rdquo;);
  fn(1);
  puts(&ldquo;usual syntax end&rdquo;);
}</p>

<p>void other_syntax (void fn (int x)) {
  puts(&ldquo;other syntax start&rdquo;);
  fn(2);
  puts(&ldquo;other syntax end&rdquo;);
}</p>

<p>void hello (int x) {
  printf(&ldquo;hello %d\n&rdquo;, x);
}</p>

<p>int main () {
  puts(&ldquo;hello world&rdquo;);
  usual_syntax(hello);
  other_syntax(hello);
}
```</p>

<p>Sure enough we get:</p>

<p><code>
hello world
usual syntax start
hello 1
usual syntax end
other syntax start
hello 2
other syntax end
</code></p>

<p>So the moral to the story I guess is that there&rsquo;s always more to your
favorite language.  From using <a href="https://github.com/nickdesaulniers/21stCenturyC/blob/master/chpt10/variadic_macros.c">variadic macros</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/nickdesaulniers/21stCenturyC/blob/master/chpt10/compound_literal.c">compound literals</a>
to enable a more <a href="https://github.com/nickdesaulniers/21stCenturyC/blob/master/chpt10/foreach.c">functional style</a>
in C to reflecting upon a function&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/length">number of arguments</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name">name</a>
or <a href="http://taylodl.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/functional-javascript-memoization-part-ii/">adding attributes to a function</a>
or the
<a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-recursive-fixed-point-y-combinator-in-javascript-for-memoization/">y-combinator</a>
in JavaScript, I learn something new every day.  And I hope that you did
too!  Thanks for reading!  If you have some other recommendations on
good programming books, or design patterns, please leave a comment or
write a reply blog post!</p>
