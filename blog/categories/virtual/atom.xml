    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Typically, when we modify a program, we’d like to run it to verify our changes.
Before booting a compiled Linux kernel image on actual hardware, it can save us
time and potential headache to do a quick boot in a virtual machine like
<a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>
as a sanity check.  If your kernel boots in QEMU, it’s not a guarantee it will
boot on metal, but it is a quick assurance that the kernel image is not
completely busted.  Since I finally got this working, I figured I’d post the
built up command line arguments (and error messages observed) for future
travelers.  Also, QEMU has more flags than virtually any other binary I’ve ever
seen (other than a google3 binary; shots fired), and simply getting it to print
to the terminal is &frac34; the battle.  If I don’t write it down now, or lose my
shell history, I’ll probably forget how to do this.</p>

<p>TL;DR:
```sh</p>

<h1>one time setup</h1>

<p>$ mkinitramfs -o ramdisk.img
$ echo &ldquo;add-auto-load-safe-path path/to/linux/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py&rdquo; >> ~/.gdbinit</p>

<h1>one time kernel setup</h1>

<p>$ cd linux
$ ./scripts/config -e DEBUG_INFO -e GDB_SCRIPTS
$ <make kernel image></p>

<h1>each debug session run</h1>

<p>$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
  -nographic \
  -append &ldquo;console=ttyS0 nokaslr&rdquo; \
  -initrd ramdisk.img \
  -m 512 \
  &mdash;enable-kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -s -S &amp;
$ gdb vmlinux
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) hbreak start_kernel
(gdb) c
(gdb) lx-dmesg
```</p>

<h2>Booting in QEMU</h2>

<p>We’ll play stupid and see what errors we hit, and how to fix them.  First,
let’s try just our new kernel:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage
</code></p>

<p>A new window should open, and we should observe some dmesg output, a panic, and
your fans might spin up.  I find this window relatively hard to see, so let’s
get the output (and input) to a terminal:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -nographic
</code></p>

<p>This is missing an important flag, but it’s important to see what happens when
we forget it.  It will seem that there’s no output, and QEMU isn’t responding
to <code>ctrl+c</code>.  And my fans are spinning again.  Try <code>ctrl+a</code>, then <code>c</code>, to get a
<code>(qemu)</code> prompt.  A simple <code>q</code> will exit.</p>

<p>Next, We’re going to pass a kernel command line argument.  The kernel accepts
command line args just like userspace binaries, though usually the bootloader
sets these up.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -nographic -append "console=ttyS0"
...

(qemu) q
</code></p>

<p>Well at least we’re no longer in the dark (remember, <code>ctrl+a</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>q</code> to
exit).  Now we’re panicking because there’s no root filesystem, so there’s no
<code>init</code> binary to run.  Now we could create a custom filesystem image with the
bare bones (definitely a post for another day), but creating a ramdisk is the
most straightforward way, IMO.  Ok, let’s create the ramdisk,
then add it to QEMU’s parameters:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ mkinitramfs -o ramdisk.img
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -nographic -append "console=ttyS0" -initrd ramdisk.img
</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we’ll (likely) hit the same panic and the panic doesn’t provide
enough information, but the default maximum memory QEMU will use is too
limited.  <code>-m 512</code> will give our virtual machine enough memory to boot and get
a busybox based shell prompt:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -nographic -append "console=ttyS0" -initrd ramdisk.img -m 512
...
(initramfs) cat /proc/version
Linux version 4.19.0-rc7+ (nick@nick-Blade-Stealth) (clang version 8.0.0 (https://git.llvm.org/git/clang.git/ 60c8c0cc0786c7f6b8dc5c1e3acd7ec98f0a7b6d) (https://git.llvm.org/git/llvm.git/ 64c3a57bec9dbe3762fa1d80055ba850d6658f5b)) #18 SMP Wed Oct 24 19:29:53 PDT 2018
</code></p>

<p>Enabling kvm seems to help with those fans spinning up:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -nographic -append "console=ttyS0" -initrd ramdisk.img -m 512 --enable-kvm
</code></p>

<p>Finally, we might be seeing a warning when we start QEMU:</p>

<p><code>
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.svm [bit 2]
</code></p>

<p>Just need to add <code>-cpu host</code> to our invocation of QEMU.  It can be helpful when
debugging to disable
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/569635/">KASLR</a>
via <code>nokaslr</code> in the appended kernel command line parameters, or via
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE not being set in our kernel configs.</p>

<p>We can add <code>-s</code> to start a gdbserver on port 1234, and <code>-S</code> to pause the kernel
until we continue in gdb.</p>

<h2>Attaching GDB to QEMU</h2>

<p>Now that we can boot this kernel image in QEMU, let’s attach gdb to it.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ gdb vmlinux
</code></p>

<p>If you see this on your first run:
<code>``
warning: File "/home/nick/linux/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py" auto-loading has been declined by your</code>auto-load safe-path' set to &ldquo;$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load&rdquo;.
To enable execution of this file add</p>

<pre><code>add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/linux/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py
</code></pre>

<p>line to your configuration file &ldquo;/home/<username>/.gdbinit&rdquo;.
<code>
Then you can do this one time fix in order to load the gdb scripts each run:
</code>sh
$ cd linux
$ echo &ldquo;add-auto-load-safe-path <code>pwd</code>/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py&rdquo; >> ~/.gdbinit
```</p>

<p>Now that QEMU is listening on port 1234 (via <code>-s</code>), let’s connect to it, and
set a break point early on in the kernel’s initialization.  Note the the use of
<code>hbreak</code> (I lost a lot of time just using <code>b start_kernel</code>, only for the
kernel to continue booting past that function).</p>

<p>```
(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
0x000000000000fff0 in cpu_hw_events ()</p>

<p>(gdb) hbreak start_kernel
Hardware assisted breakpoint 2 at 0xffffffff82904a1d: file init/main.c, line 536.
(gdb) c
Continuing.</p>

<p>Breakpoint 2, start_kernel () at init/main.c:536
536     set_task_stack_end_magic(&amp;init_task);
(gdb) bt</p>

<h1>0  start_kernel () at init/main.c:536</h1>

<h1>1  0xffffffff810000d4 in secondary_startup_64 () at arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S:243</h1>

<h1>2  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>We can start/resume the kernel with <code>c</code>, and pause it with <code>ctrl+c</code>.  The gdb
scripts provided by the kernel via CONFIG_GDB_SCRIPTS can be viewed with
<code>apropos lx</code>. <code>lx-dmesg</code> is incredibly handy for viewing the kernel dmesg
buffer, particularly in the case of a kernel panic before the serial driver has
been brought up (in which case there’s output from QEMU to stdout, which is
just as much fun as debugging graphics code (ie. black screen)).</p>

<p>```

<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>

<p>Maybe try cross compiling a kernel (you&rsquo;ll need a cross
compiler/assembler/linker/debugger and likely a different <code>console=ttyXXX</code>
kernel command line parameter), building your own root filesystem with
<a href="https://buildroot.org/">buildroot</a>,
or exploring the rest of QEMU&rsquo;s command line options.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-14T10:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2015/08/14/my-siggraph-2015-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently lucky enough to get to attend my first SIGGRAPH conference this
year.  While I didn&rsquo;t attend any talks, I did spend some time in the expo. Here
is a collection of some of the neat things I saw at SIGGRAPH 2015.  Sorry it&rsquo;s
not more collected; I didn&rsquo;t have the intention of writing a blog post until
after folks kept asking me &ldquo;how was it?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VR</h2>

<p>Most booths had demos on VR headsets.  Many were DK2&rsquo;s and GearVR&rsquo;s.  AMD and
NVIDIA had Crescent Bay&rsquo;s (next gen VR headset).  It was noticeably lighter than
the DK2, and I thought it rendered better quality.  It had nicer cable bundling,
and
headphones built in, that could fold up and lock out of the way that made it
nice to put on/take off.  I also tried a Sony Morpheus.  They had a very
engaging demo that was a tie in to the upcoming movie about tight rope walking,
&ldquo;The Walk&rdquo;.  They had a thin PVC pipe taped to the floor that you had to
balance on, and a fan, and you were tight rope walking between the Twin Towers.
Looking down and trying to balance was terrifying.  There were some demos with
a strange mobile VR setup where folks had a backpack on that had an open laptop
hanging off the back and could walk around.  Toyota and Ford had demos where you
could inspect their vehicles in virtual space.  I did not see a single HTC/Valve
Vive at SIGGRAPH.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/siggraph/s4.jpg"></p>

<h2>AR</h2>

<p>Epson had some AR glasses. They were very glasses friendly, unlike most VR
headsets.  The nose piece was flexible, and if you flattened it out, the headset
could rest on top of your glasses and worked well.  The headset had some very
thick compound lenses.  There was a front facing camera and they had a simple
demo using image recognition of simple logos (like QR codes) that helped provide
position data.  There were other demos with orientation tracking that worked
well.  They didn&rsquo;t have positional sensor info, but had some hack that tried to
estimate positional velocity off the angular momentum (I spoke with the
programmer who implemented it).  <a href="https://moverio.epson.biz/">https://moverio.epson.biz/</a></p>

<h2>Holograms</h2>

<p>There was a demo of holograms using tilted pieces of plastic arranged in a box.
Also, there was a multiple (200+) projector array that projected a scene onto a
special screen.  When walking around the screen, the viewing angle always seemed
correct.  It was very convincing, except for the jarring restart of the animated
loop which could be smoothed out (think looping/seamless gifs).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/siggraph/s5.jpg"></p>

<h2>VR/3D video</h2>

<p>Google cardboard had a booth showing off 3D videos from youtube.  I had a hard
time telling if the video were stereoscopic or monoptic since the demo videos
only had things in the distance so it was hard to tell if parallax was
implemented correctly.  A bunch of booths were showing off 3D video, but as far
as I could tell, all of the correctly rendered stereoscopic shots were computer
rendered.  I could not find a single instance with footage shot from a
stereoscopic rig, though I tried.</p>

<h2>Booths/Expo</h2>

<p>NVIDIA and Intel had the largest booths, followed by Pixar&rsquo;s Renderman.  Felt
like a GDC event, smaller, but definitely larger than GDC next.  More focus on
shiny photorealism demos, artistic tools, less on game engines themselves.</p>

<h2>Vulcan/OpenGL ES 3.2</h2>

<p>Intel had demos of Vulcan and OpenGL ES 3.2.  For 3.2 they were showing off
tessellation shaders, I think.  For the Vulcan demo, they had a cool demo showing
how with
a particle demo scene rendered with OpenGL 4, a single CPU was pegged, it was
using a lot of power, and had pretty abysmal framerate.  When rendering the same
scene with Vulcan, they were able to more evenly distribute the workload across
CPUs, achieve higher framerate, while using less power.  The API to Vulcan is
<em>still</em> not published, so no source code is available. It was explained to me
that Vulcan is still not thread safe; instead you get the freedom to implement
synchronization rather than the driver.</p>

<h2>Planetarium</h2>

<p>There was a neat demo of a planetarium projector being repurposed to display
an &ldquo;on rails&rdquo; demo of a virtual scene.  You didn&rsquo;t get parallax since it was
being projected on a hemisphere, but it was neat in that like IMAX your entire
FOV was encompassed, but you could move your head, not see any pixels, and
didn&rsquo;t experience any motion sickness or disorientation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/siggraph/s7.jpg"></p>

<h2>X3D/X3DOM</h2>

<p>I spoke with some folks at the X3D booth about X3DOM.  To me, it seems like a
bunch of previous attempts have kind of added on too much complexity in an
effort to support every use case under the sun, rather than just accept
limitations, so much so that getting started writing hello world became
difficult.  Some of the folks I spoke to at the booth echoed this sentiment, but
also noted the lack of authoring tools as things that hurt adoption.  I have
some neat things I&rsquo;m working on in this space, based on this and other prior
works, that I plan on showing off at the upcoming BrazilJS.</p>

<h2>Maker Faire</h2>

<p>There was a cool maker faire, some things I&rsquo;ll have to order for family members
(young hackers in training) were <a href="http://cannybots.com/">Canny bots</a>,
<a href="http://ebeeproject.net/">eBee</a> and <a href="http://www.withpiper.com/">Piper</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/siggraph/s6.jpg"></p>

<h2>Experimental tech</h2>

<p>Bunch of neat input devices, one I liked used directional sound as tactile
feedback.  One demo was rearranging icons on a home screen.  Rather than touch
the screen, there was a field of tiny speakers that would blast your finger with
sound when it entered to simulate the feeling of vibration. It would vibrate
to let you know you had &ldquo;grabbed&rdquo; and icon, and then drag it.</p>

<h2>Book Signing</h2>

<p>This was the first time I got to see my book printed in physical form!  It
looked gorgeous, hardcover printed in color.  I met about half of the fellow
authors who were also at SIGGRAPH, and our editor.  I even got to meet Eric
Haines, who reviewed my chapter before publication!</p>
