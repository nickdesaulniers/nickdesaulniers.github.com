Three C/C++ programmers walk into a bar. One argues that sizeof(void*) is equivalent to sizeof(long), one argues that sizeof(void*) is equivalent to sizeof(int), and the third argues it’s sizeof(long long). Simultaneously, they’re all right, but they’re also all wrong (and need a lesson about portable C code). What the hell is going on?
One of the first few programs a programmer might write after hello world is something like this:</description></item><item><title>What's in a Word?</title><link>https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2016/05/15/whats-in-a-word/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2016/05/15/whats-in-a-word/</guid><description>Recently, there some was some confusion between myself and a coworker over the definition of a &amp;ldquo;word.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a blog post about data alignment and figured it would be good to clarify some things now, that we can refer to later.
