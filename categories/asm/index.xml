Inspired by posts like My Hardest Bug Ever, Debugging an evil Go runtime bug, and others from /r/TalesFromDebugging, I wanted to share with you one of my favorites from recent memory.

The tongue of Eden was like a flawless glass; a light of total understanding streamed through it. Thus Babel was a second Fall.&amp;rsquo; And Isaac the Blind, an early Kabbalist, said that, to quote Gershom Scholem&amp;rsquo;s translation, &amp;lsquo;The speech of men is connected with divine speech and all language whether heavenly or human derives from one source: the Divine Name.</description></item></channel></rss>
