      <description>ccache, the compiler cache, is a fantastic way to speed up build times for C and C++ code that I previously recommended. Recently, I was playing around with trying to get it to speed up my Linux kernel builds, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t seeing any benefit. Usually when this happens with ccache, there&amp;rsquo;s something non-deterministic about the builds that prevents cache hits.
Turns out someone asked this exact question on the ccache mailing list back in 2014, and a teammate from my Android days supposed a timestamp was the culprit.</description>
