      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve done nothing wrong, then you&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to hide.
Wrong. Nothing ever justifies giving up your human rights , especially to prove lack of wrong doing, and any government that asks you to do so is not your friend.
Terrorism has become a weapon used against us by those elected to lead to keep us compliant, like blinders you&amp;rsquo;d put on a horse. The threat just keeps growing and growing instead diminishing, despite the money and lives we throw at it.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Internet community lost a member in the on going war against the copyright industry. While I&amp;rsquo;ve never met the deceased, or even heard of the deceased before his suicide, I&amp;rsquo;m horrified. I&amp;rsquo;m horrified that the government we are asked to put so much faith in, would give someone, not that different from myself, such a ridiculous sentence. That I could be thrown away, locked away from the things that I love for 35 years, for freeing information that should have been free, and was later made free.</description>
