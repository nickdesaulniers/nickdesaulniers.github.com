Rather than competitors duplicating effort to come up with multiple suboptimal solutions, they can collaborate together to build something greater.
Forking is the term used to denote making a copy of a codebase. The copy, known as a &amp;ldquo;fork&amp;rdquo; is used as a starting point for work that may be contributed back to the original maintainers; the canonical &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;rdquo; from which we derive our &amp;ldquo;downstream&amp;rdquo; clone.</description></item><item><title>Hidden in Plain Sight - Public Key Crypto</title><link>https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2015/02/22/public-key-crypto-code-example/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2015/02/22/public-key-crypto-code-example/</guid><description>How is it possible for us to communicate securely when there&amp;rsquo;s the possibility of a third party eavesdropping on us? How can we communicate private secrets through public channels? How do such techniques enable us to bank online and carry out other sensitive transactions on the Internet while trusting numerous relays? In this post, I hope to explain public key cryptography, with actual code examples, so that the concepts are a little more concrete.</description></item></channel></rss>
